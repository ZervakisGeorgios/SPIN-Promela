# SPIN-Promela

The programme was written using the verification modeling language Promela. The topology of this problem consists of 4 processors that send information between them in a cycle way. The processors are not allowed to send information directly between them. Processor A can send info to processor B and processor B can send info to processor C and so on. In the end, the processors need to have xchanged information with every other processor in order to form a password.
